OpenGL Minecraft World Simulator üåçüéÆ
A fully interactive 3D environment built using modern OpenGL, inspired by Minecraft's "Creative Mode." This project combines real-time rendering techniques, dynamic object animations, and immersive interactions to recreate a Minecraft-like world with added photorealistic effects.

Features
Realistic Rendering: Shadow mapping, dynamic lighting, and fog effects for a visually immersive experience.
Interactive Environment:
Navigate the world with collision detection to prevent passing through objects.
Adjust the height of objects (e.g., Creepers) dynamically using keyboard inputs.
Experience seamless teleportation between regions with visual enhancements like fog density changes.
Dynamic Characters:
Watch Villagers and Creepers move across predefined paths.
Interact with Herobrine‚Äîget too close, and your session ends!
Custom Camera:
Explore the world with a first-person perspective.
Smooth movement, rotation, and teleportation mechanisms.
Environmental Details:
A detailed map featuring the Classical Minecraft World and Nether, designed in Blender.
Dynamic effects like fog density transitions and shadow casting based on light sources.
Getting Started
Clone the repository.
Ensure dependencies (e.g., GLFW, GLEW, GLM, Assimp) are installed.
Compile and run the program to load into a Minecraft-inspired 3D world.
Key Controls
Movement: W, A, S, D for movement, and arrow keys for camera rotation.
Creeper Adjustments: I to increase height, K to decrease height.
Rendering Modes: 1 for filled polygons, 2 for wireframes, 3 for point rendering.
Debugging: Press O to display the current camera position.
Future Enhancements
Add survival mode with player-mob interactions.
Introduce weather effects like snow for the Classical Minecraft World.
Expand the map with new textures and objects, including an End portal.
Implement mob AI for dynamic interactions.
