  - Shadow mapping for depth and lighting effects.
  - Dynamic directional and point lights (e.g., torches, sunlight).
  - Fog effects for enhanced atmospheric immersion.

- **Interactive Gameplay**:
  - Free movement with collision detection to prevent walking through objects.
  - Creeper height adjustments (`I` to increase, `K` to decrease).
  - Teleportation between regions with seamless transitions (fog effects included).
  - Herobrine interaction: Get too close, and your game ends!

- **Dynamic Characters**:
  - Villagers and Creepers traverse predefined paths in the world.
  - Creeper animations, including height scaling and movement between waypoints.

- **Customizable Camera**:
  - First-person perspective with smooth controls.
  - Collision detection for realistic navigation.

- **Environmental Details**:
  - A Blender-designed map featuring the Classical Minecraft World and the Nether.
  - Dynamic shadow casting and fog density based on light and environment changes.
